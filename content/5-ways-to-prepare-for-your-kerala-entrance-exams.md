Summary: Top 5 ways to prepare for your Kerala Entrance exams.

We have always been encouraged to ask doubts. When you ask questions in the classroom, you are modeling a process that students can and should use themselves. Developmental research suggests that this drive for explanation is, in fact, in place very early in human life. We've all experienced the endless "whys?" of three-year-olds and the downright dangerous two-year-old determination to seek out strange new worlds and boldly go where no toddler has gone before.

At entri.me we have been getting e-mails, Olark chats, Whatsapp messages and SMSes with all kinds of doubts ranging from a formula in Chemistry to admission in a college. This is why we have been working on "Doubts" and is now ready to make the first version public. 

Doubts will be closely integrated with entri.me courses. For instance you will be able to ask a doubt when you are attempting a question and get answers for it from entri.me subject experts as well as the entri.me community.

Talking of the kind of questions that we expect, it can be obviously a subject related doubt, questions related to admission in colleges, questions about entri.me courses. We assure you that all the questions will be answered by our in-house subject experts. 

In short no doubt will go unanswered :)
