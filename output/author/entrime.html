</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>The entrance exams are due soon and the heat is already on. While some of you have beenpreparing specifically for the objective questions for an year or so, some others would begetting into the groove during the crash courses. Whatever be your method of preparation,it is very important that you set your priorities right and the preparation procedures perfect.Here, we discuss in short about Top 5 ways to prepare for your Kerala Entrance Exams –</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://bytebucket.org/thecoderdotin/blog.entri.me/raw/61fe39067310044909603babd9cbc55f51cf3ace/content/images/2015/03/top5-v2.jpg?token=7607fb32b02cde4b95118956747ec5960026f11b" /></p>
<h4>1. Get your basics very strong</h4>
<p>You’ll anyways be preparing for your final descriptive exams. This provides a perfect opportunity to get your basics strong, which forms the foundation for your Kerala Entrance Exam preparations. Entrance Exams aren’t about getting the complex questions answered right. Majority of the questions asked in Entrance Exams just need an application of any of the basics you have learnt. So rather than focusing on learning the tougher questions, spend that time getting your basic foundation knowledge and you’ll be good to go.</p>
<h4>2. Attend as many Mock Papers as possible.</h4>
<p>On a stop clock You knew this point would come up, didn’t you? Whenever the best practices to prepare for Entrance Exams are discussed, one is always advised to attend as many mock papers as possible. But we’d recommend not just attempting the papers butdoing so on a stop clock. Set apart 3 continuous hours without disturbance to attempt a mock paper. This technique not just gives you an experience of how the Kerala Entrance Exam would be, but also psychologically prepares you for the Exam Hallpressure scenario.</p>
<h4>3. Plan your preparation</h4>
<p>As the Kerala Entrance Exam is time-bound it is only right that your preparations also be so.Plan your preparations with Weekly and Monthly Goals, in such a way that you have the schedule prepared months in advance, right upto the previous day of your Exam.This will help you understand where you stand in your path of Entrance preparationsand ease down your unwarranted stress levels.</p>
<h4>4. Keep Reference Resources to a minimum</h4>
<p>There is one major mistake many students make while preparing for Kerala Entrance Exams – referring too many books. The problem is that when you refer too many books, it becomes the same case as too many cooks spoil the broth. The techniques in each book might be different, which, in the end might get you confused on which is the right method.Just focus on your textbook and maximum 2 more reference books. There’s only as much a brain can absorb, hence no point in stuffing it up with pointers it wouldn’tgrasp.</p>
<h4>5. Have Fun</h4>
<p>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, and so will you. No matter what anyone says, never spend all your time preparing for the Entrance Exams. Learn to relax.Over-working your brain is not going to help anyone. In fact it might result in a backlash and stress you out. Every evening take some time out to relax your mind and body – play a game of cricket, listen to music, hangout with friends etc –whichever is your version of relaxing. It is preferred you do not watch TV in this “funtime” because while watching TV, your brain is still working, trying to process all the information. Which definitely isn’t relaxing it.</p>
<h4>Bonus Point.</h4>
<p>Try out Online Adaptive Mock Entrance Exams services like <a href="http://entri.me">entri.me</a> provide you the perfect platform to prepare for your exams. Based on your each attempt, the system adapts itself to showcase your weak and strong points which in turn will help you focus on the sections that need attention.It’s similar to having a personal tutor who points out the areas you need to emphasize your preparations more on.That’s all there is you should know about getting your preparations going full-steam ahead. Do follow the points we mentioned above and we promise you’ll do great in your exams.</p>
<p>All the very best for your Kerala Entrance Exams. Now go get that rank you deserve so very much!</p>                </article>
